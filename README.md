# Intro
 > [subject](subject.pdf)

This is a System Administration subject. You will discover Docker and you will set up your first web server.
 Objectives:
 * Using ```Docker```, set up a ```web server``` with ```Nginx``` on ```Deiban Buster```.
 * Run several services at the same time: ```WordPress``` website, ```phpMyAdmin```, and ```MySQL```.
 * Apply ```SSL``` protocol.
 * Apply ```autoindex```.

 In the contents below I try to explain what are these keywords, and how they fit in this project. If you had no difficulties understanding these keywords with their links, then I suggest you to waste your time somewhere else, and not to read below this.


# Web Server

 To fetch a webpage, your browser sends a request to the web server, which searches for the requested file in its own storage space. Upon finding the file, the server reads it, processes it as-needed, and sends it to the browser.

 As its name implies, HTTP specifies how to transfer hypertext (linked web documents) between two computers.
 * Only clients can make HTTP requests, and then only to servers. Servers can only respond to a client's HTTP request.
 * When requesting a file via HTTP, clients must provide the file's URL.
 * The web server must answer every HTTP request, at least with an error message.

On a web server, the HTTP server is responsible for processing and answering incoming requests.

# Debian Buster
 You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs:
 * Most users set up Dockerâ€™s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the recommended approach, except for Raspbian.
 * Some users download the DEB package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.
 * In testing and development environments, some users choose to use automated convenience scripts to install Docker. This is currently the only approach for Raspbian.

## How I installed Docker on Ubuntu
