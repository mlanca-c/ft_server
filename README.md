# Intro
 > [subject](subject.pdf)

This is a System Administration subject. You will discover Docker and you will set up your first web server.
 Objectives:
 * Using ```Docker```, set up a ```web server``` with ```Nginx``` on ```Deiban Buster```.
 * Run several services at the same time: ```WordPress``` website, ```phpMyAdmin```, and ```MySQL```.
 * Apply ```SSL``` protocol.
 * Apply ```autoindex```.

 In the contents below I try to explain what are these keywords, and how they fit in this project. If you had no difficulties understanding these keywords with their links, then I suggest you to waste your time somewhere else, and not to read below this.

# Debian Buster
 You can install Docker Engine in different ways, depending on your needs:
 * Most users set up Dockerâ€™s repositories and install from them, for ease of installation and upgrade tasks. This is the recommended approach, except for Raspbian.
 * Some users download the DEB package and install it manually and manage upgrades completely manually. This is useful in situations such as installing Docker on air-gapped systems with no access to the internet.
 * In testing and development environments, some users choose to use automated convenience scripts to install Docker. This is currently the only approach for Raspbian.



## How I installed Docker on Ubuntu
