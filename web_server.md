# Web Server

 <details>

 To fetch a webpage, your browser sends a request to the web server, which searches for the requested file in its own storage space. Upon finding the file, the server reads it, processes it as-needed, and sends it to the browser.
 
 As its name implies, HTTP specifies how to transfer hypertext (linked web documents) between two computers.
 * Only clients can make HTTP requests, and then only to servers. Servers can only respond to a client's HTTP request.
 * When requesting a file via HTTP, clients must provide the file's URL.
 * The web server must answer every HTTP request, at least with an error message.

On a web server, the HTTP server is responsible for processing and answering incoming requests.
