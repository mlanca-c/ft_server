# All the configuration for nginx lives in the directory /etc/nginx/ with the
# /etc/nginx/nginx.conf file at the heart. 
# 1. nginx.conf:						The main configuration file of Nginx 
# 										server.
# 2. conf.d: 							The directory where user specific 
# 										configurations are stored.
# 3. site-available and sites-enabled: 	The directory where user specific 
# 										configurations are stored for Debian 
# 										like systems.
#
# sites-enabled/default: 
# server {
#	listen 80 default_server;
# 	listen [::]:80 default_server;
#
#	root /var/www/html;
#	index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;
#	server_name _;
#
#	location / {
#		try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
#	}
# }
# 
# Each single line ending with a semi-colon (;) is called a directive.
# simple directive:	name of the directive followed by a list of parameters.
# block directive:	made up to the directive name, followed by a pair of curly
# 					braces ({) within which there are multiple single
# 					directives.
#
# Ngin has server blocks that use the server_name and listen directives to bind
# to tcp sockets.
# There can be multiple server blocks that function as separate virtual web 
# server instances.
# 
# The main server block directives that Nginx is concerned with during this
# process are the listen directive, and the server_name directive.
# The listen directive typically defines which IP address and port that the
# server block will respond to.
# It is important to understand that Nginx will only evaluate the server_name
# directive when it needs to distinguish between server blocks that match to the
# same level of specificity in the listen directive.
#
# root /var/www/html;	nginx will look inside the directory of the server to
# 						look for files to serve the HTTP requests made to 
# 						https://localhost/
# Placing a root directive in the server block makes the root directive
# available to all location blocks within the same server block.
#
# server_tokens off;	directive is responsible for displaying the Nginx
# 						version number and Operating system on error pages and
# 						in the “Server” HTTP response header field.
#
# index random index.php;	The index directive defines the index file’s name.
# 							The ndex is by default the main page of the
# 							directory.
#
# Secure Socket Layer (SSL) 
# ssl_certificate (should be pointed to the location of the created Certificate
# file).
# ssl_certificate_key (should be pointed to the location of the Private Key
# generated along with the CSR that was used during Certificate activation).
#
#
# The location block enables you to handle several types of URIs/routes, within
# a server block.
# location [<modifier>] <URI> {...}
# location / {...}		location matching all requests.
# location ~ ... {...}	case sensitive modifier.
#
# autoindex on;		Enables Nginx auto indexing to browse your files from the
# 					web browser.
