# Web Server

 <details>

 To fetch a webpage, your ```browser``` sends a request to the ```web server```, which searches for the requested file in its own storage space. Upon finding the file, the ```server``` reads it, processes it as-needed, and sends it to the ```browser```.
 
 As its name implies, ```HTTP``` (**H**yper**t**ext **T**ransfer **P**rotocol) pecifies how to transfer hypertext (linked web documents) between two computers.
 * Only clients can make HTTP requests, and then only to servers. Servers can only respond to a client's HTTP request.
 * When requesting a file via HTTP, clients must provide the file's URL.
 * The web server must answer every HTTP request, at least with an error message.

On a web server, the HTTP server is responsible for processing and answering incoming requests.

# Nginx

 Nginx is an open source ```web server```.

 Nginx can also function as a ```proxy``` server for email (IMAP, POP3, and SMTP) and a ```reverse proxy``` and load balancer for HTTP, TCP, and UDP servers.
